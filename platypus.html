      The Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a small amphibious Australian mammal noted for its odd combination of primitive features and special adaptations, especially the flat, almost comical bill that early observers thought was that of a duck sewn onto the body of a mammal. 
      It is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. 
      The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912.
