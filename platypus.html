      The Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a small amphibious Australian mammal noted for its odd combination of primitive features and special adaptations, especially the flat, almost comical bill that early observers thought was that of a duck sewn onto the body of a mammal. It is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Platypus fur is waterproof and traps an insulating layer of air to keep its body temperature stable, even in cold water. Long guard hairs protect the dense fur underneath, which stays dry even after a platypus has been in the water for hours. The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912.
