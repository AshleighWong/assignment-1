        Meet the quokka - the happiest animal in the world!
        These small, mostly nocturnal marsupials were once described by a Dutch explorer as “a kind of rat”, and they were once widely distributed across the southwest of Western Australia and offshore islands. Although looking rather like a very small kangaroo, it can climb small trees and shrubs up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in). Its coarse fur is a grizzled brown color, fading to buff underneath. The quokka is known to live for an average of 10 years. Quokkas are nocturnal animals; they sleep during the day in Acanthocarpus preissii(a plant), using the plants' spikes for protection and hiding.
